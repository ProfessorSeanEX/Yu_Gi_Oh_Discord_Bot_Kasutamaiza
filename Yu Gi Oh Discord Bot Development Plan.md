# **Revised Phased Plan (Completion-Oriented)**

## **Phase 1: Core Bot & Data Infrastructure**  

**Goal**: Finish all foundation tasks so this phase is “complete” before moving on.

1. **Bot Hosting & Basic Commands**  
   - Set up 24/7 hosting (e.g., DigitalOcean).  
   - Implement `/ping`, `/help`.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Confirm minimal concurrency is stable with standard load (some users testing commands).  
     - Make sure basic error messages are user-friendly.

2. **Relational Database Setup**  
   - Tables: `users`, `cards`, `archetypes`, `banlists`, `matches`.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Ensure indexing on key fields (e.g., `cards(name)`) to handle moderate search loads.  
     - Validate relationships/foreign keys.  

3. **Custom Card Management**  
   - `/addcard`, `/removecard`, `/searchcard` with image URLs, banlist fields, etc.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Clear user feedback on success/failure, ephemeral for error messages.  
     - Confirm large card sets don’t degrade performance with indexing.

4. **Basic Moderation & Server Utilities**  
   - `/kick`, `/ban`, reaction roles, welcome messages.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Make sure logs are easy to read for staff, handle edge cases (e.g., user not found).  
     - The system is considered “complete” once all needed mod tools are proven stable.

**Outcome**: **Foundationally complete**—you won’t need major code overhauls later.  
**Estimated Duration**: ~1 week

## **Phase 2: Competitive Infrastructure (Using Duelingbook Matches)**  

**Goal**: Provide a fully operational ELO/tournament system so players can compete using Duelingbook, with no missing features.

1. **Player Profiles & ELO**  
   - `/reportmatch @winner @loser`, `/leaderboard`, `/profile @user`.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Optimize DB queries for top-10 leaderboards.  
     - Handle concurrency if many matches are reported quickly.  
     - Perfect error handling (“Winner cannot be the same as loser,” etc.).

2. **Tournament Management**  
   - `/createtournament`, `/jointournament`, bracket management.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - Thorough bracket seeding, role rewards, user-friendly progress updates.  
     - Confirm that large tournaments (e.g., 64 players) remain fast and stable.

3. **Server Engagement**  
   - Automated tourney reminders, featured cards.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Scheduled tasks run without downtime.  
     - Good logging/feedback if a reminder fails or a featured card cannot be found.

**Outcome**: The competitive environment is **fully complete** and robust.  
**Estimated Duration**: ~2 weeks

## **Phase 3: Bot-Based Dueling System**  

**Goal**: Build an in-Discord game engine that’s **complete**—covering all standard YGO rules and custom elements. No leftover “polish” as a separate step.

1. **Match Channels & Deck Handling**  
   - `/startduel @p1 @p2`, shuffles decks, deals opening hands.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:
     - Ensure multiple simultaneous matches run smoothly (concurrency).  
     - Provide robust error messages (e.g., “You can’t start a new match if you’re in one”).

2. **Turn Flow & Commands**  
   - `/draw`, `/normal_summon`, `/attack`, `/endturn` across standard phases.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - Perfect user prompts, e.g., “It’s your Main Phase 1,” “You’ve already Normal Summoned.”  
     - Index or cache the state for quick lookups in large servers.

3. **Chain Resolution & Effect Scripting**  
   - Official chain rules, simple effect scripts (destroy, banish, draw, search).  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - Ensure correct chain linking, once-per-turn checks, mandatory triggers.  
     - Build in expansions for custom effects.

4. **Advanced Summoning Methods**  
   - Tribute, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, Link, as required by your format.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - Validate user flows (e.g., tribute cost, summoning from correct zones).  
     - Full or near-official coverage so you don’t revisit these rules later.

5. **Integration with Tournaments/ELO**  
   - Automatic winner detection updates stats/tournaments.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - Large in-Discord tournaments with no slowdowns.  
     - Perfect event announcements—immediate ELO updates.

**Outcome**: A fully **complete** in-Discord dueling system that doesn’t need a separate “polish” pass.  
**Estimated Duration**: ~3–4 weeks

---

## **Phase 4: AI Integration**  

**Goal**: Incorporate the AI so that it can **assist or replace** player logic. The bot engine is already complete and can function without the AI.

1. **AI as Optional Arbiter**  
   - AI interprets card text or effect scripts, verifying legality.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - If the AI fails or times out, fallback to the bot’s existing rule scripts seamlessly.  
     - Comprehensive logs for debugging AI decisions.

2. **AI Opponent**  
   - `/duelbot`: The AI chooses moves for itself.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - If multiple players duel the AI simultaneously, ensure concurrency is stable.  
     - Thorough move logs so devs can track AI logic.

3. **AI Suggestions**  
   - `/suggestmove`: AI calculates possible combos.  
   - **Polish & Scaling**:  
     - Provide user-friendly explanations (“Why did the AI suggest this?”).  
     - AI gracefully handles unusual or custom effects.

**Outcome**: The AI layer is **complete**, with fallback to the bot’s own logic if needed, so no separate polish phase is required.  
**Estimated Duration**: ~3–4 weeks

---

## **No Separate “Polish & Maintenance” Phase**

- **Reasoning**: You’re a game designer who wants each phase “finished” to a **final** standard.  
- **Implementation**: All typical “polish” items—performance, concurrency, UX, expansions—are **integrated** directly into the relevant phase’s tasks.  
- **Result**: By the time a phase wraps, it’s effectively **production-ready**, not waiting on a separate final pass.

---

## **Overall Timeline (Completion-Focused)**

1. **Phase 1** (Core Bot & DB): ~1 week  
2. **Phase 2** (Competitive Infrastructure w/ Duelingbook): ~2 weeks  
3. **Phase 3** (Bot-Based Dueling): ~3–4 weeks  
4. **Phase 4** (AI Integration): ~3–4 weeks  

**Total**: **~2–3 months** to reach a final, fully featured system—**each phase** is done to completion with integrated polish and scaling tasks, so there’s no leftover “maintenance pass” at the end.

---

### **Conclusion**

Under this plan, **every** step is **fully completed**—optimizations, concurrency, UX improvements, expansions, etc. happen **within** each phase’s scope, leaving no separate “polish” stage. By the end of Phase 4, you’ll have a **comprehensive** custom Yu-Gi-Oh! bot that:

- Manages your cards and banlists,
- Tracks tournaments and ELO (initially using Duelingbook for actual duels),
- Provides a fully automated in-Discord dueling experience,
- And integrates a robust AI (both for rulings and as an opponent).

All **done to completion**. No further “polish only” phase needed.
